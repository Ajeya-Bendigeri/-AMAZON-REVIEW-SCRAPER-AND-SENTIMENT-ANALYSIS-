5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's my second iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in collegeI am a tech freak so you can trust my views -- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date- The camera focuses so quickly that you can takeDSLR quality photos.- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina DR display is so crisp and everything feels real.- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music- iOS has no bugs at all- 20W charging is lit- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there's no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the faceDrawbacks -- Battery could be better",128GB,Black,True
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The iPhone 12 is the latest iteration of Apple's iconic smartphone series, and it continues to impress with its sleek design, powerful performance, and impressive camera capabilities. As a proud owner of the iPhone 12, I'd like to share my experiences and thoughts in this review.Design and Build Quality (5/5):Apple's design philosophy shines through in the iPhone 12. The flat-edged, aerospace-grade aluminum frame feels premium and comfortable to hold. The Ceramic Shield front cover offers extra durability, making me feel more confident in everyday use. The device is available in a variety of stunning colors, and the Super Retina XDR OLED display is simply brilliant, providing vibrant colors and deep blacks.Performance (5/5):Equipped with Apple's A14 Bionic chip, the iPhone 12 delivers top-notch performance. It handles multitasking, gaming, and demanding apps with ease. The device feels incredibly responsive, and I've never experienced any lag or slowdown, even with resource-intensive tasks.Camera (4.5/5):The iPhone 12 features a dual-camera system with a 12 MP wide and ultra-wide lens. The Night mode and Deep Fusion technology excel in low-light conditions, and the Smart HDR 3 makes every shot look stunning. However, compared to its more expensive sibling, the iPhone 12 Pro, it lacks a telephoto lens. Nonetheless, for the average user, the camera quality is more than satisfactory.iOS 15 (5/5):The iPhone 12 runs on iOS 15, which is Apple's latest and most feature-rich operating system. It's intuitive, secure, and keeps your device up-to-date. The App Library and widgets have been great additions, enhancing the user experience. Privacy features like App Tracking Transparency are commendable.Battery Life (4/5):While the iPhone 12's battery life is decent, it may not be the best among its competitors. It comfortably gets me through a full day of moderate use, but power users might need a top-up in the evening. However, the MagSafe wireless charging and support for fast charging (adapter sold separately) make it convenient to juice up quickly.5G Connectivity (4.5/5):With 5G support, the iPhone 12 is future-proofed for faster data speeds and improved connectivity. While 5G coverage may vary by region, it's an added bonus for those planning to keep their device for a few years.Conclusion:The iPhone 12 strikes an excellent balance between style and substance. It's a device that caters to the needs of a broad user base, offering impressive performance, a stunning display, and a camera that captures beautiful moments. iOS 15 brings a plethora of features to the table, and the device's design is nothing short of elegant. While battery life and the absence of a telephoto lens might deter some, for most users, the iPhone 12 is a fantastic choice, providing a premium Apple experience without the premium price tag.",128GB,Black,True
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost",128GB,Black,True
